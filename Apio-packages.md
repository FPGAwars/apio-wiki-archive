# Introduction

The main goal of Apio is to **simplify** the work with open source FPGAs. All the toolchains needed have been packaged into several **apio packages** that can be easily installed, in all the platforms, using the **apio install** command

Each **apio package** contains all the executable and data files needed into a compressed file (.zip or .tar.gz). These packages are built  automatically or manually. Each package is stored in its own repo in the FPGAwars organization

# Apio packages
