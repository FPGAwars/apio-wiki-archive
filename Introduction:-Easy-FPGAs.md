## What is Apio?

Apio is a **multiplatform** toolbox with **static** pre-built packages to verify, synthesize, simulate and upload your verilog designs into the supported **FPGA boards**

## What??????

Apio makes **extremelly easy** the process of working with **FPGAs**. Go from **scratch** to having a **blinky LED** in your FPGA board in minutes! This is because it is based only on **Free/Libre Open Source Software** (FLOSS). Just install it and use it as you want

Think of Apio as a small **FPGA distribution**, which **collects** and **packages** **FLOSS toolchains for FPGAs**. You can install packages in **Linux**, **Mac** and **Windows** for synthesizing hardware, verifying and simulating from verilog files

The goal is making it **very easy** to start with FPGAs

Apio has a **command line interface** (CLI). It is the **building block** for other **higher level tools**, like [Icestudio](https://icestudio.io/), [Apio-IDE](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio-ide) or working with FPGAs from IDEs such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
