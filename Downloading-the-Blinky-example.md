The best way to **test** that everything is working ok with a board is to download a **blinky hello world example**, synthesize it and upload it into your board. These are the steps:

1. **Install the latest example apio package**

This is the command for forcing the installation of the **latest version**:

```
apio install -f examples
```

You can check all the **installed packaged** with this command:

```
apio install -l
```
