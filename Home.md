* **Latest stable version**: 0.9.2

Apio is a **multiplatform** toolbox with **static** pre-built packages to verify, synthesize, simulate and upload your verilog designs into the supported **FPGA boards**

Apio makes **extremely easy** the process of working with **FPGAs**. Go from **scratch** to having a **blinky LED** in your FPGA board in minutes! This is because it is based only on **Free/Libre Open Source Software** (FLOSS). Just install it and use it as you want

In this animation you can see the whole process of testing the Blinky led circuit: Just type one command and the circuit will be synthesized, and uploaded into the FPGA
