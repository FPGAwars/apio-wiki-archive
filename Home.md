Apio is a **multiplatform** toolbox with **static** pre-built packages to verify, synthesize, simulate and upload your verilog designs into the supported **FPGA boards**

Apio makes **extremely easy** the process of working with **FPGAs**. Go from **scratch** to having a **blinky LED** in your FPGA board in minutes! This is because it is based only on **Free/Libre Open Source Software** (FLOSS). Just install it and use it as you want

# Getting started

If you are new to apio, start by reading these sections:

* [Introduction: Easy FPGAs](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio/wiki/Introduction:-Easy-FPGAs)  
* [Quick Start](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio/wiki/Quick-start)

# Tutorial: Introduction to FPGA

Checkout this Tutorial, by [Shawn Hymel](https://shawnhymel.com/). **Apio** is used for building and simulating the designs on the Icestick board
